/**
 * Per-model configuration for the AGENTIC use case (tool-calling agent loop), scoped to that use case only — NOT
 * intrinsic model facts (those stay on {@see AILanguageModelSetting}) and NOT a static call-site default. It rides
 * along with whatever model the AIModelsService selects, and is applied to the request ONLY when the egress conversation
 * opts in (the agentic egress), via {@see \DDD\Domain\AI\Repo\Argus\Traits\ArgusAILanguageModelTrait}. A non-agentic
 * use of the same model keeps the provider defaults.
 *
 * Why a use-case block and not flat settings / a `#[ArgusLanguageModel]` attribute: the same model wants different
 * settings per use case (agentic → low reasoning for fast, zielgerichtete tool-calls; analysis → high), and the model
 * is chosen dynamically, so the config must travel with the selected model, not with one call-site class.
 *
 * Vendor mapping (done in the trait, proxy-normalised): `reasoningEffort` → OpenAI `reasoning_effort` /
 * OpenRouter `reasoning: {effort}` (which the proxy maps to Anthropic thinking-budget / Gemini thinking-level for
 * those vendors). `temperature` is sent only when set (null = provider default — correct for Gemini 3.x which
 * mandates 1.0 and for Claude where thinking ignores temperature).
